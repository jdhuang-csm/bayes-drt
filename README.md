# bayes_drt

*Note*: if you are having issues with `bayes_drt` or installing it for the first time, I would recommend trying out [`bayes_drt2`](https://github.com/jdhuang-csm/bayes-drt2) instead . It provides the same functionality as `bayes_drt` using a more stable interface to the underlying Stan software.

`bayes_drt` is a Python package for inverting  electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data to obtain the distribution of relaxation times (DRT) and/or distribution of diffusion times (DDT).

`bayes_drt` implements a hierarchical Bayesian model to provide well-calibrated estimates of the DRT or DDT without ad-hoc tuning. The package offers two methods for solving the model:
* Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling to estimate the posterior distribution, providing both a point estimate of the distribution and a credible interval
* L-BFGS optimization to maximize the posterior probability, providing a maximum *a posteriori* (MAP) point estimate of the distribution

It is also possible to perform multi-distribution inversions, e.g. to simultaneously fit both a DRT and a DDT, with these methods. This is an experimental feature and requires some manual tuning. See the tutorials for an example.

The package also provides ordinary and hyperparametric ridge regression methods, which may be useful for comparison or for obtaining initial estimates of the distribution. The hyperparametric ridge regression method is an implementation of the method developed by Ciucci and Chen (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2015.03.123) and expanded by Effat and Ciucci (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2017.07.050).

Several tutorials are available in `tutorials`. Additional examples and documentation will be added soon. If GitHub fails to display the tutorials ("Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?"), you can view them by going to https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ and pasting the URL for the desired tutorial in the search bar.

## November 2021 update
A substantial update was just pushed. If you are using a previous version of `bayes_drt`, there are several changes and additions to note:
* The `map_fit` and `bayes_fit` methods have been condensed to a single `fit` method, which takes a `mode` argument (`mode='sample'` for HMC sampling, `mode='optimize'` for MAP estimate))
* A new plotting module has been added, and several plotting methods are incorporated into the `Inverter` class
* The module `eis_utils` has been refactored: file loading functions were moved from `eis_utils` to `file_load`, while impedance plotting methods were moved from `eis_utils` to `plotting`
* Peak fitting functionality has been added
* Automatic outlier detection has been added - when enabled, this will automatically determine whether the regular error model or the outlier error model should be used

The tutorials have been updated to reflect these changes (except Tutorial 5 on DDT recovery). Please let me know or open an issue if you have questions or encounter errors.

## *Electrochimica Acta* article
The methods implemented in `bayes_drt` are the subject of an article in *Electrochimica Acta* (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2020.137493). The theory behind the model is described in detail in the journal article. All code used to generate the results in the manuscript are available here:
* `data` contains all experimental and simulated data files.
* `code_EchemActa` contains the code used to simulate data, estimate the DRT and DDT using `bayes_drt`, apply several other inversion methods from the literature to the same data for comparison, and generate figures.

## Installation
The easiest way to install `bayes_drt` is to first clone or download the repository to your computer, and then install with `pip`. To clone or download the repository, click the green "Code" button at the upper right. Once the repository is on your computer, nagivate to the top-level bayes_drt directory and install it with the following command:

    pip install .

The first time you import `bayes_drt`, several model files will automatically be compiled, which will take some time (~20 minutes). However, once compiled, the model files will be stored with the package and will not need to be recompiled. If you encounter an error message such as "WARNING:pystan:MSVC compiler is not supported" or "distutils.errors.DistutilsPlatformError: Unable to find vcvarsall.bat" or "distutils.errors.CompileError: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1" during this step, see the next section - you may be missing a necessary compiler. 

### Installing a C++ compiler
`bayes_drt` requires `pystan`, which requires a C++ compiler. If you already have a C++ compiler installed, such as MingW or GCC, the `stan` models may compile without any additional steps. However, if you do not have a C++ compiler or run into compile errors, you will need to install one before installing `bayes_drt`. If you're using conda/Anaconda, this can be achieved with one of the following commands:

Windows: `conda install libpython m2w64-toolchain -c msys2` 

MacOs: `conda install clang-osx64 clangxx-osx64`

Linux: `conda install gcc_linux-64 gxx_linux-64`

### Dependencies
`bayes_drt` requires:
* numpy
* scipy
* matplotlib
* pandas
* cvxopt
* pystan

These packages will be automatically installed (if necessary) when you install `bayes_drt`.

## Issues?
If you run into any issues using the package, please feel free to raise an issue, and I will do my best to help you solve it. Additionally, if you would like to apply the method for more complex analyses, please reach out - I would be happy to help get an appropriate model set up for your use case.
